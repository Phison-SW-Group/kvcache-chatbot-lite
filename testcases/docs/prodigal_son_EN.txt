# The Prodigal Son

Once upon a time, there was a wealthy father who had two sons. One day, the younger son said to his father, "Father, please give me my share of the inheritance." Though it pained him, the father granted his request and divided the property between them.

After receiving the money, the younger son left home and traveled to a distant land. There he lived a dissolute life, indulging in eating, drinking, and merrymaking, squandering everything recklessly until all his wealth was gone.

Just then, a severe famine struck that region. Penniless, the younger son was forced to work feeding pigs for someone, and he even longed to fill his stomach with the pods the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. In his despair, he came to his senses and thought, "Even the hired servants in my father's house have plenty of food, yet here I am starving to death! I will go back and admit my wrongs to my father, and ask him to let me work as a hired servant."

So the younger son set out on the journey home. While he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son, threw his arms around him, and kissed him again and again.

The younger son said shamefully, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son."

But the father instructed his servants, "Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet! Slaughter the fattened calf, and let us celebrate with a feast! For this son of mine was lost and is found again!"

When the older son returned from the field and heard the sounds of celebration, he was displeased. But the father said to him, "My son, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because your brother was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!"

This story teaches us that no matter how great our mistakes, sincere repentance can always lead to forgiveness. A father's love is unconditional, forever waiting for the prodigal to return home.
